Sparkly Event Planner


Our application will demonstrate how you can plan for special events while keeping everything organized, especially if you have clients that are specific on their requests.

Launching the application will take you to the homepage. You can casually look at the About page and Gallery page for more context of the services offered and checkout some event packages to get an idea of what our clients can receive.

But the most important button you want to click on is the “create an event” button. Once clicked, this button will direct you to a form where users can fill out their personal information and select their options for their event.

Once the form is completed, users will click “submit” and the information provided on the form will go directly to the database where it will be stored.

When you click “services,” it will take you to the backend where an Administrator will look at the event information and determine the fate of the event, whether the client wants additional services, change services originally selected or cancel the event per clients’ request. There will be CRUD features which the Administrator will be able to create an event, review the event, update an event, and delete the event.

This is a must for all Event Planners who are trying to find an easier way to organize events and keep track of all event details to keep clients happy and for the success of an Event Planner’s business.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
